Use Case
--------

The code in this repo can be used to create random groups given some set of members,
even if

1. the set of members varies between meetings
2. old group matchings should inform new group matchings

Or in plain English: You need to create group matchings on a, say, weekly, basis and
you want new group matchings to be sufficiently different from old matchings.
